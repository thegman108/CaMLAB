Much of this follows on directly from the PPO implementation from yesterday, with only a few minor adjustments and new concepts. You'll (hopefully) be pleased to learn that we're disposing of OpenAI's gym environment for this final day of exercises, and instead going back to our week 1 roots with TransformerLens!\n",

We'll then go through standard parts of the PPO setup (e.g. objective function, memory buffer, rollout and learning phases) and show how to adapt them for our transformer. Finally, we'll put everything together into a `RLHFTrainer` class, and perform RLHF on our transformer!\n",

We can attach a hook function to the residual stream at the final layer, and have it apply our value head to the residual stream values & store the output externally. Then we can use `model.run_with_hooks` to get our logits like normal, and fetch our value estimate from the external storage object.\n",

        "If you didn't go through the sampling exercises during the first day of last week, you might want to go back to them and work through the first few of them (this is not essential). Otherwise, here's a quick refresher:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The simplest form of sampling is **greedy sampling**, where we autoregressively generate text by always choosing the most likely token at each step (i.e. argmaxing over logits), appending this to our sequence, and continuing.\n",
        "- Most other forms of sampling are non-deterministic, i.e. they involve randomness. The most basic form of random sampling is choosing the next token according to the model's logit distribution.\n",
        "- Other common refinements of this basic method are:\n",
        "    - **Top-k sampling**, where we only consider the top-k most likely tokens at each step, and choose from these according to the model's logit distribution.\n",
        "    - **Top-p sampling** (also called **nucleus sampling**), where we only consider the top-p most likely tokens at each step, and choose from these according to the model's logit distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "We've provided the model sampling code for you below, because there are a few non-obvious things to consider that are specific to our current situation. Make sure you completely understand this function before moving on to the next section.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll highlight a few things about this function:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `.generate` is the standard method to autoregressively generate text. This works for TransformerLens slightly differently than for HuggingFace models (TransformerLens isn't primarily designed for text generation). In particular, it doesn't have features to efficiently generate multiple outputs for a single completion by using key-value caching. So rather than passing an argument into `generate` telling the model to generate `batch_size` outputs, we've instead just repeated `input_ids` multiple times across the batch dimension. This is a bit wasteful since we're repeating computation on the input sequence, but it's not a big problem because the input sequences we'll be using are usually very short.\n",
        "    - As a bonus exercise later, we've suggested you write a version of the `generate` method which uses TransformerLens' key value caching (since TL does support caching behaviour, it just doesn't have features to use caching in `generate` to produce multiple sequences from a single completion).\n",
        "- We've used `stop_at_eos = False`, to make sure that the model generates the full `gen_length` tokens rather than stopping early."

However, remember that RL is about performing actions, getting feedback on those actions, and using that feedback to influence your policy. The token `'.' * 64` is so unlikely to ever be generated that it'll probably never be positively reinforced, and we avoid this problem."

This is because `log_softmax` subtracts a constant from all the values to avoid any of them being extremely large when we calculate the necessary exponentials (recall that the softmax operation is translation invariant i.e. we can add the same value to all logits and the probs / logprobs are still the same). We can then take `exp` of the result to get probabilities because taking `exp` of negative values is numerically stable.

In other words, after a certain number of iterations of (rollout phase, learning phase), they add a third reward model learning phase, where the current policy generates many pairs of trajectories of some fixed timestep and the human rater chooses which one is best. They famously trained the Hopper agent to perform repeated backflips using just 900 queries.\n",
