Commonly, powers of 2 are chosen for computational efficiency, and deeper layers might have more channels to capture complex features. Additionally, this parameter is sometimes chosen based on the heuristic of wanting to balance the parameter count / compute for each layer - which is why you often see `out_channels` growing as the size of each feature map gets smaller."

If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation. Thanks to PyTorch helpfully keeping track of the parameters which require gradients (using a structure called the **computational graph**), if we set `requires_grad = False` for the first few layers of parameters in our model, PyTorch will actually save us time and compute by not calculating gradients for these parameters at all.\n",
